# 👋 Hi, I’m @GabrielBrogno6th or Gabriel


- 👀: I’m very interested in knowing about how software works, and how I can mix and match the different areas to have fun.
- 🌱: Currently, I'm learning and evolving my experience with c, python, java, javascript, data science, machine learning, devOps, web programming
 and its many frameworks. I'm kinda in a back-end/full-stack vibe.
- 💞️: I’m looking to collaborate on a diferent range of softwares to meet new tech, methods and ways to solve problems in a easy way,
 because I like to be Lazy in my spare time. There is so much to do...
- 📫 Wanna talk or have something interesting to show?
