# 👋 Hi, I’m @GabrielBrogno6th or Gabriel

- 👀: I’m looking to practice and enhance my skills stack, learn new things by creating my personal projects, and maybe even collaborating in open-source projects.
- 🌱: Currently, I'm practicing:
      - Web Development:
        - Flask and Django for backend Web Development;
        - JavaScript (vanilla) (or TypeScript) with Angular for frontend;
      - SQL:
          -T-SQL
      - Data Engineering, Data Science:
          - Pandas
          - PySpark
      - DevOps:
          - Linux
          - Docker
 But I know Java (Spring Cloud) and C. -> I should practice more...
- 💞️: I’m looking to collaborate on a different range of software to meet new tech, improve everyday life, and diminish the gap between people and tech.
  Tech is awesome, but we need to use it in a good, ethical manner. 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
